## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Resolved Issues

- **Missing Documentation**: Users were unaware of the {upcoming_reservations} placeholder added in v2.2.0
- **Discovery Problem**: No way to see what placeholders were available without checking code or documentation
- **Template Type Confusion**: Unclear which placeholders were available for customer vs admin templates

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Upgrade Instructions

1. **Backup First**: Always backup your database before updating
2. **Existing Templates**: Your existing email templates are not modified by this update
3. **New Feature**: This only adds documentation UI - the placeholders themselves work the same as before
4. **No Database Changes**: This update does not modify database structure

### Regarding {upcoming_reservations}

- This placeholder was added in v2.2.0 but wasn't documented in the UI
- If you haven't used it yet, you can now add it to your admin notification template
- It shows a formatted table of all upcoming reservations (next 7 days)
- The current reservation is highlighted in yellow
- **Only works in Admin templates** - will be blank in customer emails

---

## üéØ What This Fixes

### User-Reported Issue

> "The admin default email does not send a list of upcoming reservations and a variable for that to put into the email is not listed"

**Resolution**:

- The variable `{upcoming_reservations}` exists and works (added in v2.2.0)
- This update makes it **visible and discoverable** in the UI
- Now clearly documented with description: "List of upcoming reservations (next 7 days) (Admin only)"

### Developer Note

The functionality was implemented correctly in v2.2.0, but we failed to add UI documentation for discoverability. This update fixes that oversight with a comprehensive placeholder reference system.
