# Power Reservations v2.3.0 - Changelog

## Release Date: October 15, 2025

## Overview
Major feature release adding intelligent time slot capacity limiting. Restaurants can now set maximum reservation limits for each time slot, with automatic capacity checking and real-time availability display. This prevents overbooking and provides customers with up-to-date slot availability.

---

## ‚ú® Major New Features

### Time Slot Capacity Limiting System
- **Per-Slot Capacity Settings**: Each time slot now has its own configurable capacity limit (default: 10 reservations)
- **Real-Time Availability**: Time slots dynamically load based on current bookings when customers select a date
- **Automatic Capacity Checking**: System verifies capacity before accepting reservations, preventing overbooking
- **Full Slot Handling**: Time slots at capacity are disabled with "(Fully Booked)" label
- **Low Capacity Warnings**: Shows remaining spots when 3 or fewer reservations remain (e.g., "6:00 PM (2 spots left)")

### Dynamic Time Slot Loading
- **AJAX-Powered**: Time slots load dynamically when date is selected
- **Capacity-Aware**: Only shows available times or marks full slots as disabled
- **Real-Time Updates**: Checks current reservations before displaying options
- **Seamless UX**: Works with both shortcode forms and Elementor widget

---

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### Admin Settings Interface
- **Capacity Input Fields**: New number input next to each time slot for capacity setting
- **Visual Design**: Clean, modern layout with proper spacing and alignment
- **Default Values**: New slots default to capacity of 10
- **Validation**: Capacity minimum of 1, maximum of 999

### Frontend Form Experience
- **Smart Time Loading**: Time dropdown says "Select date first..." until date is chosen
- **Availability Feedback**: Shows remaining capacity for low-availability slots
- **Disabled Full Slots**: Full time slots appear grayed out with "(Fully Booked)" label
- **Error Handling**: Clear messaging if selected time fills up before submission

### Visual Indicators
```
Available (Plenty of Spots):
  ‚Üí 6:00 PM

Available (Low Capacity):
  ‚Üí 6:30 PM (2 spots left)

Fully Booked:
  ‚Üí 7:00 PM (Fully Booked) [disabled]
```

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Data Structure Changes
- **New Format**: Time slots now stored as array of objects: `[{time: "6:00 PM", capacity: 10}]`
- **Automatic Migration**: Old format (simple string array) automatically converts to new format
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing time slots migrated seamlessly on first load
- **Default Capacity**: Migrated slots get capacity of 10

### Backend Enhancements
- **Enhanced AJAX Endpoint**: `pr_check_availability` returns detailed slot information
  - `available` (boolean): Whether slot has capacity
  - `capacity` (int): Maximum reservations for this slot
  - `remaining` (int): Number of spots left
  - `value` (string): Time slot value
  - `label` (string): Display label

- **Capacity Validation**: Pre-submission checks prevent race conditions
- **Database Queries**: Efficient counting of existing reservations per time slot
- **Status Filtering**: Only counts 'pending' and 'approved' reservations toward capacity

### Frontend JavaScript Updates
- **New Function**: `loadAvailableTimeSlots(date)` - Centralized slot loading
- **Multiple Selectors**: Supports various form ID patterns (#pr_time, #pr-time, #pr-elementor-time, etc.)
- **Date Change Handlers**: Listeners for both datepicker and regular date inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for AJAX failures
- **Console Logging**: Detailed debugging information for troubleshooting

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Email Time Display
- **Issue**: Time was being processed through `strtotime()` and reformatted, causing errors with formats like "6:00 PM"
- **Fix**: Now uses time exactly as stored/selected (e.g., "6:00 PM" displays as "6:00 PM")
- **Applies To**: 
  - Customer confirmation emails
  - Admin notification emails  
  - Upcoming reservations table
- **Result**: Times in emails now match exactly what customer selected

### Time Slot Rendering
- **Issue**: Forms pre-loaded all time slots regardless of availability
- **Fix**: Time slots now load dynamically based on selected date
- **Impact**: Prevents customers from selecting unavailable times

   - Time: "6:00 PM"
   - Capacity: 10
4. Set different capacities for different times:
   - 5:30 PM ‚Üí Capacity: 5 (smaller early slot)
   - 6:00 PM ‚Üí Capacity: 15 (prime time, higher capacity)
   - 9:30 PM ‚Üí Capacity: 8 (late slot, reduced capacity)
5. Click "Save Settings"

### Example 2: Customer Experience

2. Selects date: October 20, 2025

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v2.2.x

**Automatic Migration**:
- Old time slot format automatically converts to new format on first load
- No manual intervention required
- Existing reservations remain unchanged

**What Happens**:
```
BEFORE (v2.2.4):
pr_time_slots = ["6:00 PM", "7:00 PM", "8:00 PM"]

AFTER (v2.3.0):
pr_time_slots = [
  {time: "6:00 PM", capacity: 10},
  {time: "7:00 PM", capacity: 10},
  {time: "8:00 PM", capacity: 10}
]
```

**Post-Upgrade Steps**:
1. Go to Reservations ‚Üí Settings
2. Review auto-assigned capacities (default: 10)
3. Adjust as needed for your business
4. Save settings

### Database Impact
- **No schema changes**: Uses existing options table
- **No data loss**: All reservations preserved
- **Backward compatible**: Code handles both old and new formats

## üìä Capacity Management Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower capacities and adjust up based on actual capacity
2. **Peak Times**: Increase capacity for popular time slots (e.g., 7:00 PM on weekends)
3. **Off-Peak Times**: Reduce capacity for slower periods
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check reservation reports to see which slots fill up
5. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Modify capacities for holidays, events, special occasions

### Recommended Capacities
- **Small Restaurant** (30-50 seats): 5-8 reservations per slot
- **Medium Restaurant** (50-100 seats): 10-15 reservations per slot
- **Large Restaurant** (100+ seats): 15-25 reservations per slot

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Party Size Consideration**: Capacity counts reservations, not total guests
   - Future enhancement: Could track total party_size vs. capacity
2. **No Waitlist Feature**: Full slots are disabled, no waitlist option
   - Consider for future version
3. **No Table Management**: Doesn't integrate with specific table assignments
   - Basic capacity only

### Workarounds
- **Party Size Concern**: Set conservative capacities accounting for average party size
- **Waitlist Need**: Use special_requests field for waitlist manually
- **Table Assignment**: Manage table assignments separately in admin area

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Party size-based capacity (track total guests, not just reservations)
- [ ] Time slot templates (copy capacity settings across days/weeks)
- [ ] Capacity override for specific dates (holidays, events)
- [ ] Visual capacity indicators in admin dashboard
- [ ] Waitlist management system
- [ ] Table assignment integration
- [ ] Capacity history and analytics
- [ ] Bulk capacity editing
- [ ] Time slot groups (e.g., "Dinner Service" 6-9 PM)
