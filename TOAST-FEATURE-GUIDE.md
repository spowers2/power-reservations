# Toast Notification Feature - v2.0.6

## Quick Overview

Instead of showing a success message above the form that requires scrolling, the plugin now displays a beautiful toast notification in the top-right corner of the screen!

## What You'll See

### When Submitting a Reservation

1. **Fill out the form** → Click "Make Reservation"
2. **Button changes** → "Submitting..."
3. **Toast appears** → Slides in from right side
4. **Form resets** → Ready for next reservation
5. **Toast disappears** → After 6 seconds (or click X)

## Toast Appearance

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓  Reservation confirmed!              ✕│
│     Confirmation code: ABC123DEF456      │
│     Check your email for details.        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Green checkmark icon
- 📝 Bold title
- 🔢 Confirmation code displayed
- 📧 Email reminder
- ✕ Close button (top-right)
- 🎨 Green left border accent
- 💫 Smooth slide-in animation

## Desktop vs Mobile

### Desktop (>768px)

- Appears in **top-right corner**
- Max width 400px
- Floats over content
- Doesn't block form

### Mobile (<768px)

- Appears at **top of screen**
- **Full width** (with 10px margins)
- Still floats over content
- Optimized touch targets

## User Actions

### Toast Auto-Dismisses

⏱️ Waits 6 seconds → Slides out → Disappears

### Or User Can Dismiss

🖱️ Click X button → Immediate slide out → Disappears

### Multiple Toasts

If user submits multiple reservations quickly:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Reservation #1   ✕│
└─────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Reservation #2   ✕│
└─────────────────────┘
┌─────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Reservation #3   ✕│
└─────────────────────┘
```

They stack vertically!

## When Errors Occur

**Errors DON'T use toasts** - they appear in the message div above the form:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Please fill in all required     │
│    fields before submitting         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

[Form Fields]
Name: _____________
Email: ____________
```

This ensures errors are **near the fields** that need attention.

## Benefits

### For Restaurant Staff

```

}
```

## Demo Scenario

**Restaurant Customer:**

1. Goes to "Make a Reservation" page
2. Fills in: Name, Email, Phone, Date, Time, Party Size
3. Clicks "Make Reservation"
4. **Sees toast:** "✅ Reservation confirmed! Confirmation code: XYZ789..."

7. Happy customer! 😊

## Troubleshooting

### Toast doesn't appear?

- Clear browser cache (hard refresh)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify jQuery is loaded
- Check that `frontend.js` and `frontend.css` are loaded

### Toast appears but looks wrong?

- Clear WordPress cache
- Clear CDN cache
- Check for CSS conflicts with theme
- Verify `frontend.css` has the new toast styles

### Multiple toasts overlap?

- This is by design - they stack
- Each auto-dismisses after 6 seconds
- User can manually close them
