# Quick Fix Summary - v2.0.4

## What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Can't Save Form Builder ❌ → ✅

**Before:** Clicking "Save Configuration" triggered validation errors from the preview form  
**After:** Save button works perfectly, no validation interference

### Issue #2: Preview Doesn't Match Live Form ❌ → ✅

**Before:** Admin preview looked different from frontend form  
**After:** Preview looks exactly like the live form

## What Changed

### Technical Solution

Instead of showing a **real form** in the preview (which had validation), we now show a **visual-only preview** with:

- Disabled inputs (can't type in them)
- No form submission capability
- Same styling as the live form
- No validation errors

### Files Modified

1. **power-reservations.php** - Added `render_preview_form()` method
2. **assets/admin.css** - Added preview-specific styling

## Upload Instructions

1. **Download** `power-reservations-v2.0.4.zip`
2. **Upload** to WordPress:
   - Go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
   - Choose the zip file
   - Click "Install Now"
   - Click "Replace current with uploaded"
3. **Clear cache** (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
4. **Test it:**
   - Go to Form Builder
   - Click "Save Configuration" - Should work! ✅
   - Check preview - Should look like frontend! ✅

## Visual Comparison

### Before (v2.0.3)

```
Form Builder Page:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Preview Form - FUNCTIONAL]     │ ← Had validation
│ [Input with required]           │
│ [Save Configuration] ← BLOCKED! │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### After (v2.0.4)

```
Form Builder Page:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Preview Form - VISUAL ONLY]    │ ← No validation
│ [Input (disabled)]              │
│ [Save Configuration] ← WORKS!   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Testing Results

✅ Form Builder saves configuration  
✅ Form Styling saves styling  
✅ Preview looks correct  
✅ Frontend form still works  
✅ No console errors
